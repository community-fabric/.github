# IP Fabric

[IP Fabric](https://ipfabric.io/) is a vendor-neutral network assurance platform that automates the
holistic discovery, verification, visualization, and documentation of
large-scale enterprise networks, reducing the associated costs and required
resources whilst improving security and efficiency.

It supports your engineering and operations teams, underpinning migration and
transformation projects. IP Fabric will revolutionize how you approach network
visibility and assurance, security assurance, automation, multi-cloud
networking, and trouble resolution.

# GitHub Migrations

## Community Fabric to GitLab Integration

Our 2023 goal is to proivde you with production ready Integrations supported by our Solution Architect team.

In order to align the Solution Architect team with company development and security standards we have decided to move this project to
[IP Fabric Integrations](https://gitlab.com/ip-fabric/integrations) in GitLab.  This migration will allow all members of the IP Fabric team to
contribute and provide feedback on our projects.

These projects will continue being open source allowing you to create issues inside GitLab and opening Merge Requests for contributing.
If you do not have a GitLab account you are easily able to create one using your GitHub account.  We will also accept
feedback, features, and bugs through communication with your Solution Architect.

**One of the benefits of this migration is that you can open Confidential Issues that only our team can view enabling you to post logs
without worrying about redacting sensitive information.**

To mark an issue as confidential simply check the box next to 
`This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access.` under the Issue description.

## Community Fabric to IP Fabric GitHub

As time progresses we are looking to migrate away from this org and move to the [IP Fabric GitHub Organization](https://github.com/ipfabric).
This provides us a company branded and managed Organization for any project we require using GitHub.
